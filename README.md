# Basic-Structure-for-Wordpress-Theme-from-Scratch
When I started learn build a Wordpress Theme from scratch I don't find no one repository with a basic structure for save time create each php file and folders, so I decide create this repository for me and, why not? sharing with who need it.

This repository have the super basic structure and code in the files like functions.php to start, it's no completed yet because I wish improve it bit a bit while I learn more. 

If you can be help to improve the structure and code will be great for me and the people that decide use it.
